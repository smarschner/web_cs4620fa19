<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
When displaying images, the pixels of the image don't usually line up with the pixels of the display.  We need to be able to display images at different sizes and positions, and as we will see as we learn more graphics, in many applications it's also important to be able to rotate, distort, and shift images with sub-pixel accuracy.

<p>
The general problem of moving an image from one pixel grid to another is called <em>resampling</em>.  The core idea is to find the location of each of the pixels of the destination image in the pixel grid of the source image, then <em>interpolate</em> to get a value at that location.  Interpolation is needed because the destination pixels are not going to fall exactly at the locations of the source pixels, so we need a way to make up pixel values at locations between the source pixels.

<p>
This assignment is primarily about implementing the most commonly used methods for interpolating images in the context of resampling.  They are
<ol>
	<li>Nearest-neighbor sampling: This is the simplest (and generally fastest) way to resample images.  It is what you would do if it hadn't yet occurred to you that interpolation was necessary: just use the closest pixel in the source image.  You will see that it produces some annoying (and familiar) "digital looking" artifacts.</li>
	<li>Linear interpolation: This is the workhorse for image resampling in interactive graphics.  It's still simple and fast, but it reduces the artifacts a lot.</li>
	<li>Bicubic filtering: This is the most commonly used method when quality matters.  It considerably improves the artifacts of linear interpolation, though it takes more time.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Warmup</h4>

<p>
As a warmup for this assignment, do the following problem and put the answer into a comment at the top of <tt>FilterResampler.java</tt>.

<p>
In this warm-up exercise, you'll compute the weights corresponding to pixels in an image interpolation operation, using the same parameters as used by the resample method in the programming part.

<p>
Suppose we have a grayscale source image that is 8x8 pixels in size and has a 2x2 white (pixel value 1.0) square in the center (covering pixels (3,3) to (4,4)), on a black (pixel value 0) background.  The position of the bottom-left source sample point in the source image, src[0,0], is defined as (0,0).  We resample the source image to a destination image of size 5x5 using the source rectangle (left, bottom, right, top) = (2.4, 3.2, 4.8, 5.6).  The position of bottom-left vertex of the source rectangle is at (2.4, 3.2) in source image coordinate, but the bottom-left destination sample point, dst[0,0], doesn't locate at (2.4, 3.2).  Depending on the interpolation filter we used for this operation, we see different results in the output image; some examples are:
<ol>
<li>Nearest neighbor: dst[1,1] = 1.0; dst [1,3] = 0</li>
<li>Linear interpolation: dst[0,3] = 0.0768; dst[1,1] = 1.0; dst[1,2] = 0.6</li>
<li>B-spline cubic: dst[1,2] = 0.5092</li>
</ol>

<p>
In each of these cases, what are the input pixels that contributed to the output pixel, and what are their weights?  You can entirely omit pixels that make zero contribution to the result (and their weights).  It's helpful to first figure out pixel postion of destination image.  Please write the result in the following format.  Suppose output pixel [2,3] landed at (3.5, 2.5) in the source image and you are using linear interpolation (this is <em>not</em> where pixel [2,3] actually falls!).  Then dst[2,3] would have the value 0.5 and you would write:

<pre>
dst[2,3] = 0.25 * src[3,3] + 0.25 * src[4,3] = 0.5
</pre>

<p>
In this example source pixels [3,2] and [4,2] would also contribute with weight 0.25, but their values are zero so they are omitted.

<p>
Round your results to the nearest ten-thousandth.  Note that the output values above provide a check on your weights.  Also, the following illustration is to scale and can help you sanity-check your numbers.

<h4>Assignment</h4>

<p>
The assignment framework displays an image in a resizable window, and uses an interface <tt>ResampleEngine</tt> to compute the image that is displayed in the window.
<a href="https://github.com/smarschner/frameworks_cs4620fa19">Here</a> is the link to the assignment framework on GitHub.  If you use <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, you can select "import projects" and then click "Projects from Folder or Archive".  Click "Directory" and choose the folder "filters" to import as Eclipse project.  Right click and select "Configure Build Path" to configure Libraries if needed (the provided build path should work on MacOS and Windows).  For the MacOS platform, you need to create a run configuration with the required "-XstartOnFirstThread" VM argument, otherwise the application will immediately crash.

<p>
The single method in the interface has the signature:
<pre>void resample(SimpleImage src, SimpleImage dst, double left, double bottom, double right, double top);</pre>
This method computes the destination image <tt>dst</tt> using image content that comes from a rectangle in the source image <tt>src</tt>, maintaining the existing size of the destination image.  The source rectangle extends from <tt>left</tt> to <tt>right</tt> and <tt>bottom</tt> to <tt>top</tt> and is measured in units of input pixels.  For instance, setting the source and destination sizes both to width \(n\) and height \(m\) and the rectangle to \((-0.5, n - 0.5, -0.5, m - 0.5)\) produces an unshifted, unscaled (though possibly slightly blurred, depending on the resampling algorithm) copy of the source image.

<p>
There are several implementations of this interface, but the only one that is complete does not actually implement this specification&mdash;it doesn't resample at all but rather copies pixels directly from the source to the destination, ignoring the source rectangle.  Your job is to complete the other three implementations of this interface:

<ol>
	<li><tt>NearestNeighborResampler</tt>.  To get the value for a destination pixel, you just compute the coordinates of the sample point in the source image, round to the nearest integer, and read a single pixel.</li>
	<li><tt>LinearResampler</tt>.  To get the value for a destination pixel, compute a weighted average of the four source-image pixels that surround the sample point, using bilinear interpolation weights.</li>
	<li><tt>FilterResampler</tt>.  This class supports resampling using any filter; the framework provides linear and cubic filters but <tt>FilterResampler</tt> just interacts with them through the <tt>Filter</tt> interface.  Computing a destination pixel involves visiting all the source pixels that fall within the support of the filter, weighting each according to the filter's value for the offset between the sample point and the pixel position.  Since this implementation supports arbitrary sized filters, this filtering method can handle minification (downsampling) well: when the destination pixel spacing is smaller than 1 source pixel, the filter should be used at its natural radius, and when the destination pixel spacing is larger, the radius should be set to its radius times the destination pixel spacing.
</ol>

<p>
These resampling algorithms are all discussed in greater detail in the lecture slides and in Chapter 9 of the textbook.  At the boundaries of the image, clamp the row and column indices of any pixel accesses that fall outside the image to the edges of the image so that the color of the last pixel extends past the edge.  The result looks like <a href="assignments/a1_filters/clamp_example.png">this</a> when the source rectangle extends outside the bounds of the source image.

<p>
The <tt>SimpleImage</tt> class is just what it says: a dead-simple image class that has just a width, a height, and an array of bytes that holds the pixel values.  Images always have three channels, and the pixels are organized from left to right and bottom to top.  For instance, a small image with width 3 and height 2 would have <tt>data.length == 18</tt>; the red, green, and blue components of the lower-left pixel at <tt>data[0]</tt>, <tt>data[1]</tt>, and <tt>data[2]</tt>; the upper-left pixel in <tt>data[9]</tt> ... <tt>data[11]</tt>; and the last pixel is the upper-right pixel at <tt>data[15]</tt> ... <tt>data[17]</tt>.  In order to access the pixel data you will need to compute indices into this array; you can compute them directly in your resampling code, but things may turn out more readable if you make use of the provided method stubs for <tt>SimpleImage.getPixel</tt> and <tt>SimpleImage.setPixel</tt>.
<p>
Please notice that pixel value <tt>data[i]</tt> has the Java type <tt>byte</tt>, which is awkward because the pixel value is unsigned but Java always treats integer types as signed, so if you don't do anything special, pixel values above 127 will be interpreted as negative numbers.  The way to deal with this is with an expression like <tt>data[i] &amp; 0xff</tt>, which has the effect of transferring the 8 bits of the <tt>byte</tt> into an <tt>int</tt>, where they represent the correct value in the range [0, 255].  In converting your result back to <tt>byte</tt>, a simple cast will do the job, but you need to watch out for values that might be negative or greater than 255; you should clamp these to 0 and 255.


<h4>Framework</h4>

<p>
You can complete this assignment keeping completely within the abstraction boundary provided by the <tt>ResampleEngine</tt> interface.  But you may like to look around the code to see how things work.  The framework is an fairly minimal example of the use of the OpenGL 3 API, which it accesses from Java using the <a href="http://lwjgl.org">Lightweight Java GL (LWJGL) 3</a> library, which provides a very direct translation of the C API as a collection of static methods in Java.  For windowing it uses the <a href="http://glfw.org">GLFW</a> library provided through LWJGL.  Since GLFW is quite low-level, the <tt>ResampleApp</tt> is built on the base class <tt>cs4620.util.SimpleOpenGLApp</tt>, which provides a simple and reasonably familiar interface in terms of and <tt>init</tt> (called once at startup) and <tt>draw</tt> (called once per frame) methods, plus a collection of simple event handlers for window resizing, keyboard input, and mouse/trackpad input.

<p>
Some of the functionality you fill find in <tt>ResampleApp</tt>:
<ul>
	<li>It reads some images from disk with hard-coded filenames.  These are easy to change if you'd like to load other images.</li>
	<li>It provides a simple pan-and-zoom UI that controls the source rectangle; the destination image size is controlled by resizing the window.</li>
	<li>Each frame, it calls the resampler with the source image and a destination image that matches the current window dimensions, and writes the destination image to an OpenGL texture of that same size.  Then it draws that texture pixel-for-pixel into the window.
	<li>It provides keyboard controls to change which resampler class is in use:
		<ul>
			<li><tt>B</tt>: B-spline</li>
			<li><tt>C</tt>: Catmull-Rom</li>
			<li><tt>M</tt>: Mitchell-Netravali</li>
			<li><tt>L</tt>: Linear with direct implementation (using <tt>LinearResampler</tt>)</li>
			<li><tt>F</tt>: Linear with filter interpolation (using <tt>FilterResampler</tt> with  <tt>LinearFilter</tt>)</li>
			<li><tt>N</tt>: Nearest neighbor</li>
			<li><tt>P</tt>: PixelCopier (default)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Notice that PixelCopier is a trivial version of "resampling" that just copies the bottom left pixels. It doesn't support up/downsample.
</ul>

<h4>Expected results</h4>

<p>
<!-- <a href="">Here</a> is a video of how our solution behaves.

<p>
<!-- To help you determine whether your implementation is exactly correct, the framework supports setting the view to a fixed rectangle by pressing the <tt>T</tt> key.  For testing you can change this rectangle by editing the code in <tt>ResampleApp.keyEvent</tt>, but don't lose track of the original rectangle; once your code is working you can test it precisely by setting this view, writing an image to disk with the <tt>W</tt> key, and then comparing the result with the following images:
 -->
You can resize the window to exactly match the image with the <tt>R</tt> key, save an image with the <tt>W</tt> key, and close window with the <tt>Esc</tt> key.
To help you determine whether your implementation is exactly correct, the framework supports setting the view to a fixed rectangle and writing an image to disk by pressing the <tt>T</tt> (<strong>T</strong>est) key. An image is saved with current filter type in name, and you can compare the result with the following images, which can also be found at <tt>data/cactus_reference_images</tt>.
<p>
To save a test image with certain filter, you need to press the key corresponding to the filter (B, C, F, L, M, N), and then immediately press key T.  When using key R, it will change the filter to default one (PixelCopier), and pressing T yields a different view from our reference images.
