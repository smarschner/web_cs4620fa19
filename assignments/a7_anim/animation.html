<h3>Programming Part</h3>
<p class="duedate">Due: Friday December 6th 2019 (11:59pm)</p>
<p><strong>Do this part alone or in groups of two, as you prefer.</strong>

<!--<h3>The Framework</h3>-->

    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>
    In this assignment, we will explore keyframe animation, one of the fundamental methods for creating motion in computer graphics.  The nomenclature of keyframe animation comes from the tradition of hand-drawn animation, in which a lead animator plans out a sequence (consisting of a succession of separate drawings photographed onto frames of film or video) by drawing a few important instants in the motion, known as the key frames or <i>keyframes</i>, and assistant animators known as in-betweeners complete the animation by drawing the frames that fill the time between the keyframes.  When done correctly this results in smooth motion that conforms to the poses and timing defined by the keyframes.</p>
<p>
    In keyframes for computer animation, properties of objects in a scene (especially including the transformations that define their positions) are specified for particular moments in time, and these properties are then interpolated across time to create continuous motion, which can be sampled at any desired rate to produce the frames of an animation.  The crucial operation needed to render keyframe animations is interpolation: for any particular point in time, the properties of each object are computed by finding the relevant keyframes (normally one or two before the current time and one or two after) and interpolating between the data stored at those frames.</p>
<p>
    For this assignment, you will write the core interpolation code for a simple system for animating 3D shapes arranged in a transformation hierarchy. The only properties you will animate are the transformations, expressed as 3D translations, rotations, and scales. In addition, you will create your own character and interesting animations with it.

A new commit has been pushed to the <a href="https://github.com/smarschner/frameworks_cs4620fa19">frameworks_cs4620fa19 repository</a>. The framework for this assignment is under the <tt>manip</tt> directory.
For this project, we use lwjgl, so you may need to update some settings of your build to have this external library work properly. We have included the correct jar files, but you may need to configure your native library location. To do this in Eclipse, go to <tt> Project -&gt; Properties -&gt; Java Build Path -&gt; Select Libraries -&gt; Select the lwjgl Drop Down Menu -&gt; Modify Native Library Location. </tt> Modify this setting so that it matches your OS. We have added a framework in the package anim that stores keyframes and provides an interface for editing them.
</p>

  We have added a framework in the package anim that stores keyframes and provides an interface for editing them; you will build on that framework and implement a few main features that enable correct interpolation of animations between keyframes. -->

    <h4>The Interface</h4>

    <ul>
        <li> Select a frame: Left click on the frame in the timeline.</li>
        <li> Adding a keyframe: To add a keyframe at the current frame, press the n key. The new keyframe will be initialized to the current state of the scene when you clicked the button.</li>
        <li> Editing a keyframe: Left click on it, edit the transformations at that state, and press <tt>N</tt> to update the keyframe's transformation.</li>
        <li> Removing a keyframe: Navigate to a keyframe and press the <tt>M</tt> key to remove.</li>
        <li> Playing and pausing the animation: The <tt>space bar</tt> is used to play or pause the animation.</li>
        <!--<li> Changing the method of rotation: The <tt>/</tt> key is used to alternate between three methods of rotation.</li>-->
        <li> Manipulator: Right click on a object to reveal its manipulators. Press <tt>T</tt> <tt>R</tt> <tt>S</tt> to switch between translation, rotation and scaling manipulators. Drag on the manipulator with right mouse button to transform the object. Note that only the manipulators enabled for a node will be displayed. See section on creating a character for details.
        <li> Camera pan and tilt: Left click and drag.
            <ul>
              <li><tt>WASD</tt>: Move the camera left/right, zoom in/out</li>
              <li>Left/Right <tt>SHIFT</tt>: Move the camera up/down</li>
              <li>Arrow keys: Tilt the camera upward/downward or to the left/right</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Save scene to file: Press F4 to save current scene (excluding timeline) to <tt>data/scenes/Saved.xml</tt>.
    </ul>

    <h4>Keyframes</h4>

    For this problem, we have extended the scene graph system to store information about the transformations of each object at multiple keyframes. This information is managed by the <tt>AnimationEngine</tt>, which keeps an <tt>AnimationTimeline</tt> for each animated object in the scene.  The animation data is stored in the <tt>AnimationTimeline</tt>s, each of which contains:
    <ul>
        <li> A <tt>TreeSet</tt> of <tt>AnimKeyFrame</tt>. Each key frame contains a frame index number and a 4 x 4 matrix transformation.</li>
        <li> A <tt>SceneObject</tt> that this timeline operates on.</li>
    </ul>
    Every time the <tt>update</tt> loop is called in the Game loop, <tt>AnimationEngine.updateTransformations</tt> is called.  For each timeline, this method calls <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt>, which computes the transformation for a single object at the current time. Finally <tt>AnimationEngine.updateTransformations</tt> sends a transformation-update event to the corresponding <tt>SceneObject</tt>.


    <h4>What You Will Do</h4>

    Most of the parts you need to implement are in AnimationTimeline.java. You will also implement the quaternion interpolation method in the library.
    <ul>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.addKeyFrame</tt>.</li>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.removeKeyFrame</tt>.</li>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt> &mdash; 
            A method that computes the transformation for the current time.</li>
        <li> Implement <tt>egl.math.Quat.slerp</tt> in <tt>src/egl/math/Quat.java</tt>.</li>
        <li> Create Your Own Character &mdash; 
          After completing this short coding assignment, create a character with the provided primitives (spheres, cubes and cylinders) and any additional object you like (specified by OBJ files), and put it in <tt>Character.xml</tt>. Your character should have at least three rotational joints. See <tt>data/scenes/Robot.xml</tt> for an example. If you cannot come up with anything interesting, we recommend recreating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr.">Pixar Luxo Jr. lamp</a> using cones, cylinders, as well as spheres for joints.</li>
        <li> Create Interesting Animation &mdash; 
            Use your own character to create an interesting animation. This should showcase all of your working transformations, i.e. rotationswith respect to at least three joints, and at least one translation or one scaling. Screen capture your animation and include this video in your submission.</li>
        <!--<li> Create Buggy Animation &mdash;
          After you have implemented the three methods of rotation use one of the included scenes to demonstrate a "bug" with using Euler angles to interpolate rotations, and then show how using a spherical linear interpolation between quaternions resolves the issue. Screen capture your animation and include this video in your submission.</li>-->
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Interpolation Overview</h4>

    <h5>The na&iuml;ve linear approach</h5>

    When computing the interpolation of two transformations, the naive approach is to linearly interpolate each of the 12 free values of the 4 x 4 matrix. You may want to try this out and see why this doesn’t work so well. See what happens when you rotate an object 180 degrees!

    <!--<h5>A better approch</h5>

    Linearly interpolating rotations by value does not work very well. While scales and translations can be linearly interpolated to give good results, the same doesn’t apply to rotations. So what can we do? 

    <p>Part of the problem with the linear approach is that the interpolated transformation might not be a rotation even if the two keyframe transformations are pure rotations.  One approach is to generalize we would do in 2D: convert the rotation matrix to an angle, and interpolate the angle.  The easiest way to generalize this is using Euler angles: we write the transformation as a product of three rotations that are around coordinate axes, like this:
    \[R(\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z) = R_z(\theta_z) R_y(\theta_y) R_x(\theta_x).\]
    If we have two rotations \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), we first convert them to \((\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z)_1\) and \((\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z)_2\).  Then we linearly interpolate these two 3-vectors to get an interpolated set of angles, and then compute the interpolated rotation from the interpolated Euler angles.

    <p>The general idea for making this work while still supporting general matrix transformations is:
    <p><ul>
        <li> Decompose the surrounding 4x4 matrix transformations around the current key frame into rotations, translations, and scales.  (Details below.)</li>
        <li> Linearly interpolate the translations and scales, and interpolate the rotations by converting to Euler angles, interpolating, and then converting the resulting angles back to a rotation matrix.</li>
        <li> Recompose the constituents to give a transformation for the current frame.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can use the provided <tt>eulerDecomp</tt> method to convert a matrix to Euler angles.  Try this out once you get it working&mdash;it should work pretty nicely for coordinate axis rotations, but you should be able to find some cases that behave really strangely.  (See the lecture notes for some hints.)-->

    <h5>A better approach</h5>

    It turns out there is a good way to interpolate between two pure rotations, that behaves well for any two rotations: first express the rotations as quaternions, then interpolate between the quaternions.  As discussed in lecture, the best way to interpolate (which results in a constant speed across the whole interval between two keyframes) is to use spherical linear interpolation, abbreviated &ldquo;slerp,&rdquo; to interpolate between the quaternions.  This replaces the middle step with:

    <p><ul>
        <li> Linearly interpolate the translations and scales, and interpolate the rotations by converting them to quaternions, interpolating between the quaternions, and then converting the resulting quaternion back to a rotation matrix.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>See below for a discussion of the conversions and interpolation methods.

    <h5>Decomposing transformations</h5>

    The better method requires taking a general matrix and expressing it as a combination of rotation, translation, and scale.  A homogenous transformation M is a 4x4 matrix that can be decomposed firstly as follows

    \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
    RS & T \\
    0 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]

    Here, \(T\) represents the translation, \(R\) the rotation and \(S\) the scale. So just how do we decompose the upper left 3x3 portion of the matrix into its constituents? Polar decomposition. You will find an algorighm to compute the polar decomposition implemented in <tt>egl.math.Matrix3.polar_decomp</tt> for you.

    There is more about Euler angles, quaternions, spherical linear interpolation, and the polar decomposition in the Animation lecture slides and notes, and in Chapter 17 of the textbook.

    <h4>Slerp</h4>

    Spherical linear interpolation occurs between quaternions, so we need to convert our representation of \(R\) as a 3 x 3 matrix into a quaternion for each keyframe, and then convert the interpolated quaternion back to a matrix.

    <h5>Converting between Rotation Matrices and Quaternions</h5>

      We do not ask you to implement the inter-conversion between rotation matrices and Quaternions. You can use the class <tt>egl.math.Quat</tt> to convert from a rotation matrix (using the appropriate <tt>Quat</tt> constructor) and to a rotation matrix (using the <tt>toRotationMatrix</tt> method). Feel free to look at the code to understand how it works if you’re interested. All you need to know about Quaternions is that they are 4-vectors, and that unit-length quaternions, called unit quaternions, can represent 3D rotations and also interpolate them well.


    <h5>Linear Interpolation</h5>

    Typically, we visualize quaternions as vectors that represent rotation. Yes, they have 4 numbers, but as most things with higher dimensionality, imagine them to be in a lower dimensional space, say 2D, and say “four” to yourself. Given two quaternions \(q_1\) and \(q_2\), and a \(t\) to interpolate such that \(0 < t < 1\), a linear interpolation, or lerp, q is given by:

    \[
    q = (1 - t)q_1 + tq_2
    \]
    This will work, if we normalize the interpolated quaternion so that it’s a unit quaternion again, but unfortunately the rotation does not happen at constant speed—it will go faster towards \(t=0.5\) and slower towards the ends.

    <h5>Spherical Linear Interpolation</h5>
    Intuitively, spherical linear interpolation, or slerp, gets around this problem by interpolating these quaternions (read: vectors) along the sphere they are both a part of. We’ll avoid the details of the derivation of the slerp formula, which are in the lecture slides. Let’s just review how slerp is calculated. Given quaternions \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) at the surrounding key frames and an interpolation ratio \(t\) such that \(0 < t < 1\), we first calculate the angle between \(q_1\) and \(q_2\), called \(\Omega\), as follows:

    \[
    cos\Omega = q_1 \cdot q_2
    \]

    Then the interpolated quaternion q is given by

    \[
    q = \frac{sin(\Omega - t\Omega)}{sin\Omega}q_1 + \frac{sin(t\Omega)}{sin\Omega}q_2
    \]

    <p> You are asked to implement this in the <tt>egl.math.Quat.slerp</tt> function, in <tt>src/eglmath/Quat.java</tt>. You will first calculate the angle \(\Omega\) between \(q_1\) and \(q_2\). If it is smaller than 0.01, apply linear interpolation. Otherwise, apply spherical linear interpolation.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>You will also need to support spherical linear interpolation of quaternions in the function <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt>. </p><!-- The mode currently selected is indicated by the argument <tt>rotation</tt>. We have described the two modes in detail above. In order to implement Euler angles, you will need to decompose the rotation matrices into Euler angles (using a function we have provided), linearly interpolate, and then recompose into a rotation matrix (you will find useful Matrix3 functions for this).-->

    <h4>Build Your Own Character</h4>
    You are expected to build your own character using the provided primitives (spheres, cylinders, cubes and cones in <tt>data/meshes/cone.obj</tt>) as well as any additional OBJs you like. See the <tt>data/scenes/Robot.xml</tt> for reference. Your character should be modelled hierarchically, and have at least three rotational joints (ankles, wrists, elbows, knees, etc.), represented by spheres. The following fields can be specified for enabling/defining transformations for the nodes.
    <ul>
      <li><tt>rotateX</tt>, <tt>rotateY</tt>, <tt>rotateZ</tt>: Each takes two float parameters specifying the range of the rotation in degrees. The range is clamped to [-180.0, 180.0] in the code. The rotation in a direction is only enabled when the corresponding field is defined, e.g. if you only specify <tt>rotateX</tt> for a node, then its rotations in the y and z directions are disabled. </li>
      <li><tt>enableScale</tt>: Takes three integer parameters of values 0/1 corresponding to scaling in the x, y and z directions. For example, <tt>&lt;enableScale&gt;0 1 0&lt;/enableScale&gt;</tt> enables scaling a node in the y direction only. Scaling is disabled for a node if this field is not specified.</li>
      <li><tt>enableTranslate</tt>: Similar to <tt>enableScale</tt>, takes three integer parameters of values 0/1 corresponding to translating in the x, y and z directions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Specify the rotation ranges carefully such that all possible motions of your character are physically reasonable. For example, the elbow should only bend inwards and never outwards. To rotate a node with respect to another node, e.g. rotate the lower arm with respect to the elbow, you should specify the elbow as the parent of the lower arm, and enable the rotation in the x, y or z direction for the lower arm.
    <p>
    Store your character in <tt>Character.xml</tt> in the top-level folder of the assignment. If you cannot come up with anything interesting, we recommend recreating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr.">Pixar Luxo Jr. lamp</a> using cones, cylinders, as well as spheres for joints. </li>
    </p>

    <h4>Create Interesting Animation</h4>
    Your animation should demonstrate the possible motions (scale, rotation, and translation) of your character. If you have a lamp character, the lamp should be able to jump forward and bounce in place. Keep in mind that inserting keyframes and changing the motion by a little every frame will help achieve smoother motions.  

    <h3>Build Your Transform Hierarchy Wisely</h3>
    When you change the parent of an object, the inherited base transformation will also change. This may sometimes lead to unexpected consequences if the transform hierachy is designed poorly. Try changing the parent of the Teapot in <tt>Table.xml</tt> and see what happens. <tt>Table2.xml</tt> models exactly the same scene but with a better transform hierachy.

    <h3>Demo Video</h3>

    <h3>What to Submit</h3>

    Submit a zip file containing:
    <ol>
        <li> Your solution organized the same way as the code on CMS. Please include your <tt>.classpath</tt> and <tt>.project</tt> in the submission as well as all the pre-existing files in the codebase, and not merely your modified files.
        </li><li> Your animation videos.
        </li><li>A readme file containing
            <ul>
                <li> You and your partner’s names and NetIDs.
                </li><li> Any problems with your solution.
                </li><li> Anything else you want us to know.
                </li></ul>
        </li></ol> 
        The framework for this assignment is a simple animation player that supports loading and playing animations of hierarchical 2D scenes.  Articulated figures are particularly common animation subjects, and we include a couple of simple character-like figures to use as examples.  Once loaded into the system, a model is a hierarchy of <tt>Shape</tt> objects, each with a rectangular image that defines its appearance and transformation parameters that describe its location in the scene.  The transformation parameters are:
        <ol>
            <li>Translation (a 2-vector)</li>
            <li>Rotation (a scalar angle in degrees)</li>
            <li>Scale (a 2-vector for scaling along x and y)</li>
            <li>Pivot (a 2d point in local coordinates)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because these are animatable parameters, they are stored not just as simple values, but as <tt>Timeline</tt> objects, each containing a default value (used as a constant when there are no keyframes) and a sequence of <tt>Keyframe</tt>s.  Each keyframe has a time (measured in 1/24-second frames) and a value for the parameter.  Timelines and keyframes are parameterized by the type of the interpolated parameter (<tt>Vector2</tt>, <tt>Double</tt>, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this is just an animation player, it has very simple controls like a video player: play/pause, single frame forward/back, and go to start/end.
    </p>
