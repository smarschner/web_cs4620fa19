    <h3><strong>Due: Friday October 18th 2019 (11:59pm)</strong></h3>
    <p>Note: You should feel free to use a symbolic algebra package, such as <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/linear-algebra/">Wolfram Alpha</a> (easiest to get started with, not so easy to automate), <a href="https://sandbox.open.wolframcloud.com">Wolfram Cloud</a> (access to the underlying language for Alpha, offered in freemium model), or <a href="https://live.sympy.org">SymPy</a> (open source system with many of the capabilities of Wolfram Cloud), and/or numerical math tools like a scientific calculator or Matlab/NumPy/Julia etc., to help with these problems.

     <h4>Q1. Transformation matrices</h4>
 <ol type="a">
    <li>Write the matrix for a CCW rotation by 60 degrees around the origin.  Verify it by transforming the points (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1) to ensure they go to the right places.
    <li>Write the matrix for a CW rotation by 60 degrees around the point (1,1).  Verify it by transforming the points (1,0), (2,0), and (1,1) to ensure they go to the right places.
    <li>Compute the composition of these two rotations in the two possible orders.  Describe the resulting transformations in words (e.g. as a rotation about a point, a translation, etc.).
</ol>
 
<h4>Q2. Manipulator Warmup</h4>
<p> Manipulators are 3D user interface elements that allow the user to edit the transformation of an object. In this question, we will consider a translation manipulator. A translation manipulator can be thought of as a ray in three-dimensional space that corresponds to an object space axis (either x, y, or z) for a given object. One challenge with implementing manipulators to map the user's action (in a 2-D image plane) to a 3-D transformation. We are given the coordinates and direction of the manipulator and two click locations on screen, and the question is: what translation should be applied to the object?</p>
 <p> Consider a manipulator as a ray with origin \(\mathbf{o}\) and direction \(\mathbf{d}\). Any point \(\mathbf{p}\) on that ray can be described by a parameter t: \(\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}\). For a translation manipulator, the goal is to find the positions on the ray that the user clicked (\(t_1\) being the first click point, and \(t_2\) being the second). Once we've determined the best \(t_1\) and \(t_2\), we can then apply a translation transformation on the object in the object's frame along the manipulator's axis by the amount \(t_2-t_1\).</p>
 <h5>Parameters</h5>
<ul>
<li> The camera is at the origin pointing in the negative \(z\) direction, the \(y\) axis is up (as per usual)
<li> The image plane is a square in the \(z=-3\) plane with side length 6 centered at \((0,0,-3)\).
<li> The translation manipulator's origin is located at \((2,2,-5)\)
<li> The translation manipulator is pointing in the direction of \((-1,-1,-1)\). Note that you should normalize this vector such that your final parameter values match ours
<li> The translation manipulator corresponds to the object's object-space x-axis.
<li> The user has clicked on world-space coordinates \(\mathbf{c}_1 = (2,1.5,-3)\) and \(\mathbf{c}_2 = (-1,0,-3)\) [note that these are on the image plane]
</ul>
 Here are some reference images that might be useful for you to visualize the process of determining \(t_1\) and \(t_2\).

 <h5>Questions</h5>
<ol>
<li> Our first job is to describe the rays outgoing from the eye intersecting the image plane in the places where the user clicked. What are the equations of the two rays in question?
<li> Next, we need to find the world coordinates of the points where these rays intersect the plane defined by the translation manipulator's origin and direction. A point and a direction, however, aren't enough to determine a plane -- we need an additional constraint. We want the plane to contain...
<ol>
<li>the manipulator's origin</li>
<li>the manipulator's direction</li>
<li>a ray perpendicular to the manipulator's ray and parallel to the image plane </li>
</ol>
What are the coordinates of the two points in question?
<li> Now we need to find the points on the manipulator ray that are closest to these points. Keeping in mind that points on our ray can be completely described by their associated \(t\) parameters, what are \(t_1\) and \(t_2\)?
<li> Finally, what is the matrix we would apply to translate the object appropriately in its own coordinate space?
</ol>
